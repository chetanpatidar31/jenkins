that is docker desktop (local)

to run docker we have to create some file like

docker-compose.yml   :-extention in yml
Docker               :-no extention

and your project folder/file


and open cmd and run some cmd to run the docker

>-docker-compose build   to build the image
>-docker-compose up -d   to build the container and run the container
>-docker-compose down    to stop the container and delete the container 


that is docker hub (global)repo.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to use the docker hub we must have docker image in the docker desktop

if we have image in the docker desktop we can push that image in the dockerhub repo. using some command that is 

>-docker login                                                  :-to login the docker
>-docker tag image name docker_username/image name:tag          :-to gave the tag to the image
        ex:>-docker tag tomcat-docker-tomcat aastiksahu/tomcat:now

>-docker push docker_username/image name:tag                    :- to push the image in the docker hub repo.
        ex:>-docker push aastiksahu/tomcat:now

>-docker pull docker_username/image name:tag                      :-to pull the image in the docker hub to where you want to pull
        ex:>-docker pull aastiksahu/tomcat:now
